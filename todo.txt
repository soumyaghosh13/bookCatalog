 when we will implement search of 1.3, should we remove the search facility of 1.2. There should be no option like search "paulo" or that should also included.

Tagging is a concept that helps in classifying any item under multiple categories. 
For example, a book can be tagged as Indian, Sports, Cricket or as Comic or as Humour etc.
 
Implement tagging for the books in the bookcatalog.
You should be able to: 

Add tags to the books 
bookcatalog tags add "isbn:140870420X;tags:novel,tragedy" 
It should not throw any error if a tag is already present

Search books by tags  
bookcatalog search -tag "tragedy" 
bookcatalog search "tragedy"

Remove tags from a book. 
bookcatalog tags remove "isbn:140870420X;tags:tragedy,comic"
It should not throw any error if a tags are not present
 
Also, the bookcatalog list and bookcatalog search commands should henceforth display the tags of books along.
